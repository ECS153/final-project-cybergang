#Milestone 2

19 May 2020 - 26 May 2020

For our meeting this week, we discussed what was attainable for the overall performance of our application. We realized we 
might not be able to go as far as creating new ways to secure the contents in our web application. 
However, we do know that it'll be a secure application through login means. Overall, we were able to create
a good login system, without the security measures in place yet. This'll be our primary objective for the primary week.
We will strive to finish the login logic and authentication process.

##Julia:

Last week I implemented the sign up interface and set up the database we will be using.
This Week I plan on finishing up the backend logic of our login system.
Stuck on authentication flow.
##Steven:

Last week I created our design doc and did plenty of research with new ways we can secure login information, tampered a bit with password salting.
Plan on actually implementing some sort of password salting.
Stuck on what information we should try to at least store, if time permits.

##Luis:

Created milestone2.md and helped work on a very surface level login feature without any of the security measures.
For this upcoming week I will create a meaningful flow of how our login/sign up process should look like with the time constraints.
I am stuck on how it is that we can include faceID in our code. Is there a general source code available that will trigger the feature?
