#Milestone 2

19 May 2020 - 26 May 2020

For our meeting this week, we discussed what was attainable for the overall performance of our application. We realized we might not be able to go as far as creating new ways to secure the contents in our web application. However, we do know that it'll be a secure application through login means. Overall, we were able to create a good login system, without the security measures in place yet. This'll be our primary objective for the primary week. We will strive to finish the login logic and authentication process.

##Julia:

Last week I implemented the sign up interface and set up the database we will be using. This Week I plan on finishing up the backend logic of our login system. Stuck on authentication flow. 

##Steven:

Last week I created our design doc and did plenty of research with new ways we can secure login information, tampered a bit with password salting. Plan on actually implementing some sort of password salting. Stuck on what information we should try to at least store, if time permits.

##Luis:

Created milestone2.md and helped work on a very surface level login feature without any of the security measures. For this upcoming week I will create a meaningful flow of how our login/sign up process should look like with the time constraints. I am stuck on how it is that we can include faceID in our code. Is there a general source code available that will trigger the feature?

#Milestone 1

11 May 2020 - 17 May 2020

For our meeting this week, we discussed what our Vault app would do. We decided to focus on the login and authentication portion of the app, so the actual app funtionality will relatively simple. If we have time we would like to implement a password manager, but we aren't sure about the difficutly of creating a password mananger or if our app could be secure enough to store passwords. We are all relatively new at making web apps so researching and figuring out what helpful tools already exist and how to use them takes up a significant portion of our time. Ultimately, we ended up working on the front end aspect of our project and researching the tools/technology that we will need to make sure we're using up to date login/authentication methods.


##Julia: 
  1. Last week I implemented the front end of the web application after understanding what our group wanted, nothing much so far. 
  2. This Week I plan on polishing the front end completely so it doesnt have to be tampered with anymore Then we can focus on the backend.
  3. Stuck on knowing what we should focus more effort on, authentication and logins or creating a secure web app that can carry sensitive data.

##Steven: 
  1. Researched what we can use to implement our web app moving forward, for now decided we could make good use of node.js and express.
  2. Plan to set up our database this week that will store basic user information and safely store passwords. 
  3. I am currenlty stuck on deciding what database to use. 

##Luis: 
  1. Created the design doc and project proposal.
  2. Research plausable ways of preventing attackers from taking over user accounts, and different ways of attacking our web app so we can come up with solutions to these problems.
  3. Stuck on how we can make our vault application a place that can actually hold important data.
