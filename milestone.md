Milestone 1

11 May 2020 - 17 May 2020

For our meeting this week, we discussed what our Vault app would do. We decided to focus on the login and authentication portion of the app, so the actual app funtionality will relatively simple. If we have time we would like to implement a password manager, but we aren't sure about the difficutly of creating a password mananger or if our app could be secure enough to store passwords. We are all relatively new at making web apps so researching and figuring out what helpful tools already exist and how to use them takes up a significant portion of our time. Ultimately, we ended up working on the front end aspect of our project and researching the tools/technology that we will need to make sure we're using up to date login/authentication methods.
